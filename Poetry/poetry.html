<b><h4> Pain that comes and goes </h4></b>


 
<p>
Spending hours and hours in despair <br>
 Happy, smiling faces everywhere<br>
 Tears tries to flow but cannot go,<br>
 Good results failed to come, you know.<br>
 </p>
 
<p>
Looking around for a glimpse of hope<br>
 Hoping I’d finally be able to cope<br>
 Right here, right now, I do not know<br>
 What will happen in my future so,<br>
</p>

<p>
Not only because I got a bad grade<br>
 Also afraid I’d spoil my parents day<br>
 Tough luck this time, so be it,<br>
 Next time I’ll be back on my feet<br>
</p>

<p>
Thinking: what should I do now<br>
 Study, I tell myself, but how?<br>
 Pain comes quick and painfully<br>
 Looking at myself disdainfully<br>
</p>

<p>
Now I know not what to do<br>
 Study harder, that’ll help fool<br>
 Now with a painful heart and mind<br>
 I move on, enlightenment I seek to find<br>
</p>

<p>
Moving on, I’d try to find<br>
 Something that’ll make me fine<br>
 Now I think not how to feel better<br>
 But how to make me excel greater<br>
</p>

<p>
Moving on I choose the path<br>
 Positive mindset I hath<br>
 Now I try not to think about these<br>
 The pain and agony I try to leave<br>
</p>

<p>
But how to do better I do not know<br>
 I’ve tried many strategies to do so<br>
 But what to do now, how to go?<br>
 I tell myself, you should already know.<br>
</p>

<p>
But the confusion that in me lasts<br>
 I have never felt in the past<br>
 I’ve tried so many ways to pass<br>
 But now I still end up unable to grasp<br>
</p>

<p>
Disappointment and fear<br>
 Of what might already be here<br>
 The results will be back, oh dear<br>
 Time to switch back to mugging gear<br>
</p>

<p>
Now, as sad as I possibly can be<br>
 I go on to seek the needs I see<br>
 To study harder and score better<br>
 You know it takes effort for the latter<br>
</p>

<p>
I need to find an inspiration soon<br>
 “I shall find it soon” my mind booms<br>
 The sad thoughts that flood my mind<br>
 Is no more, I tell myself, for I’m not blind<br>
</p>

<p>
Failure, a stepping stone to greatness<br>
 My soul  can feel some numbness<br>
 As I move on, continue marching forth<br>
 Eventually it might have some worth<br>
</p>

<p>
Now I am done expressing my feelings<br>
 That mistakes are part of human beings<br>
 And seek to move forth from all the pain<br>
 That I have caused, now feeling disdain<br>
</p>
